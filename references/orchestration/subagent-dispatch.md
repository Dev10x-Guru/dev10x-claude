# Pattern 4: Subagent Dispatch

Use subagents to reduce main-session token usage. Feed them
only the context they need; receive only the summary back.

## When to dispatch subagents

| Scenario | Dispatch? |
|----------|-----------|
| Research/exploration (docs, codebase) | Yes — Explore agent |
| Independent triage (N items, no shared state) | Yes — parallel general agents |
| Sequential execution (rebase, ordered commits) | No — run inline |
| Quick lookup (single file read, one grep) | No — direct tool call |

## Dispatch pattern

```
Agent(
    subagent_type="Explore",
    description="Research payment retry patterns",
    prompt="""
    Context: We're implementing retry logic for Square payments.
    The current code is in src/payments/square_client.py.

    Find:
    1. Existing retry patterns in the codebase
    2. Square API documentation on idempotency
    3. Test patterns for retry scenarios

    Return: A summary of patterns found with file paths and
    line numbers. Do not return full file contents.
    """
)
```

**Key principles:**
- Include only relevant context in the prompt (not full conversation)
- Ask for summary output, not raw data
- Use `run_in_background=true` when you have other work to do
- Use `isolation="worktree"` when the agent needs to modify files
- **Specify `model:` explicitly** for generic-purpose agents —
  see `.claude/rules/model-selection.md` for the tier framework:
  `haiku` for monitoring/gathering, `sonnet` for analysis,
  `opus` for code review and architecture decisions

## Parallel dispatch

When N items need independent processing, spawn agents in a
single tool-call block:

```
# Triage 4 PR comments in parallel
Agent(description="Triage comment r101", prompt="...", run_in_background=true)
Agent(description="Triage comment r102", prompt="...", run_in_background=true)
Agent(description="Triage comment r103", prompt="...", run_in_background=true)
Agent(description="Triage comment r104", prompt="...", run_in_background=true)
```

Collect results as notifications arrive. Update tasks accordingly.

## Background Agent Tracking (GH-854)

When launching a background agent via `run_in_background=true`,
the caller session MUST create a visible tracking task so the
supervisor knows work is ongoing:

```
TaskCreate(
    subject="PR #N monitor running (background)",
    description="Background agent monitoring CI. "
                "Output at {output_file}",
    activeForm="Monitoring PR #N")
TaskUpdate(taskId=..., status="in_progress")
```

Mark `completed` ONLY when the agent's completion notification
arrives — NOT on dispatch. Without this task, the session
appears idle and may be closed prematurely.

This pattern applies to ALL skills that launch background
agents, not just `gh-pr-monitor`.

## Wave-Based Orchestration

When orchestrating multiple independent analysis phases, structure
work into logical waves with explicit task dependencies:

**Wave structure:**
1. **Setup (sequential)**: Create tasks, detect context, initialize state
2. **Wave 1 (parallel)**: Independent analysis phases with no inter-phase dependencies
3. **Wave 2 (parallel)**: Analysis phases dependent on Wave 1 output
4. **Synthesis (sequential)**: Consolidate findings, present decisions to user

**Task dependency annotation:**
```markdown
Set dependencies:
- Task 1→2→3: Sequential setup chain (prerequisite context)
- Task 4 and 5: Blocked by task 3 (Wave 1 — independent, run in parallel)
- Task 6, 7, 8: All blocked by task 4 (Wave 2 — run in parallel after Phase 1 output)
- Task 9: Blocked by tasks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Synthesis — depends on all analysis)
```

**When to use wave-based orchestration:**
- Multiple independent analysis phases (e.g., 5+ parallel subagents)
- Partial dependencies between phases (some are independent, others depend on earlier outputs)
- Long-running workflows where parallelization saves significant time
- Example: `Dev10x:skill-audit` with 5 parallel analysis phases + dependency on Phase 1 output

## Fanout Execution (Multiple Items)

When executing a plan with multiple independent items (fanout), each item
MUST execute the **full orchestration pipeline** — not a collapsed subset.
Fanout does NOT exempt individual items from verification, grooming, or
review guardrails.

**Anti-pattern (PROHIBITED):**
```
for each issue:
  branch → edit → commit → push → create-pr   # 5 steps
```

This collapses the pipeline and skips:
- Verification (design review, implementation review)
- Grooming (commit message validation, fixup handling)
- Re-review (CI must run after grooming, pre-merge checks)

**Required pattern:**
```
for each issue:
  full play → branch → design → implement → verify →
  review → commit → groom → update → ready → verify-acc   # 12+ steps
```

**Why:** Evidence from audit session 05d49f11 showed that agents
rationalized pipeline collapse under fanout: "parallel processing
optimizes by reducing steps." This assumption was wrong. Each issue
requires independent verification and review. Parallel execution
(via Agent with `run_in_background=true`) is orthogonal to the
pipeline length — parallelizing execution does NOT justify skipping
steps.

**Phase reference pattern:**
Create a "Phase Reference" section in SKILL.md that documents each phase's
inputs, outputs, and instructions. This section can be pasted verbatim into
subagent prompts without modification:

```markdown
## Phase Reference

### Phase 1 (Output file: <PHASE1_OUTPUT>)
[Phase 1 instructions and acceptance criteria]

### Phase 2 (Output file: <PHASE2_OUTPUT>)
[Phase 2 instructions and acceptance criteria]

## Synthesis (Phase 6)
[Synthesis instructions]
Read all output files from phases 1-5 to synthesize findings.
```

Subagents receive only the relevant phase section, reducing prompt size and
improving focus.

**Cross-phase dependency handling:**
When a synthesis phase reads output from earlier phases, verify the dependency
list includes all upstream phase tasks. Example: If synthesis reads `<PHASE1_OUTPUT>`,
task 4 (Phase 1) must be in the synthesis task's `blockedBy` list.

## Permission-Aware Parallel Dispatch

When executing parallel work streams, classify each task **before dispatch**
to avoid Write/Edit tool failures in background agents:

| Task type | Write/Edit needed? | Dispatch method |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Issue implementation | Yes | Main session via `Skill()` |
| PR with code fixes | Yes | Main session via `Skill()` |
| Conflict resolution | Yes | Main session via `Skill()` |
| PR ready-to-merge | No | Background `Agent()` OK |
| CI monitoring | No | Background `Agent()` OK |
| Investigation/analysis | No | Background `Agent()` OK |

**Decision rule**: If a task MAY create or edit files, it MUST run in the main
session via `Skill()`. Background agents are only safe for read-only operations
due to `bypassPermissions` non-propagation.

**Example**: A `fanout` skill routes a PR with unaddressed review comments
to `Skill()` for inline fixes, but routes a CI-green PR with no comments to
background `Agent()` for merge monitoring.

See `.claude/rules/essentials.md` "Permission & Tool Availability Limits"
for the complete constraint specification.
