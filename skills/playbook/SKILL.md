# Dev10x:playbook — Playbook Manager

Guided interface for viewing and customizing playbook YAML files
(`references/playbook.yaml` within any playbook-powered skill)
so users never need to edit raw YAML.

## Instructions

The full workflow — discovery, inspection, guided edit flow,
reset to defaults, tier resolution — lives in
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md).

When this skill is invoked, Read `instructions.md` now and
follow it end-to-end. `TaskCreate` calls and `AskUserQuestion`
gates documented there are REQUIRED.
