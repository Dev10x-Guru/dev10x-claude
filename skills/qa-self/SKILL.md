# Self-QA — Automated Staging Test Execution

Execute QA regression test cases on staging using headless
Playwright, capture screenshot and video evidence, and post
structured results to Linear.

## Instructions

The full workflow — test case discovery, Playwright execution,
evidence capture, Linear upload, result formatting — lives in
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md).

When this skill is invoked, Read `instructions.md` now and
follow it end-to-end. `TaskCreate` calls documented there are
REQUIRED.
