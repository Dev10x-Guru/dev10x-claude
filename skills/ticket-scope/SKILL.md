# Ticket Scope — Linear Ticket Scoping Skill

Create comprehensive technical scoping documents for Linear
tickets. Extends the base `Dev10x:scope` skill with Linear-
specific workflows (ticket fetch, comment back, story point
estimation, acceptance criteria).

## Instructions

The full workflow — ticket fetch, context gathering, research
loop, story point sizing, AC generation, comment writeback —
lives in [`instructions.md`](instructions.md).

**REQUIRED before ANY other tool call:** Read
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md) end-to-end. The
orchestration contract (TaskCreate calls, phase ordering,
AskUserQuestion gates, mandatory delegations like
`Skill(Dev10x:jtbd)` and template selection) lives there —
not in this SKILL.md. Skipping the read causes downstream
phase bypasses (GH-26, GH-27, GH-28).

**Self-check after the read:** Confirm you can name the
six TaskCreate subjects, the Phase 4b skill delegation,
and the Phase 5.1 templates before fetching the ticket.
If you cannot, re-read the file. Do NOT proceed to
`mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__issue_get` (or any other tool)
until the read is complete.
