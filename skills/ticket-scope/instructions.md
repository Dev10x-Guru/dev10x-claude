# Ticket Scope — Linear Ticket Scoping Skill (Instructions)

## Overview

This skill creates comprehensive technical scoping documents for Linear tickets. It extends the base `scope` skill with Linear-specific workflows.

**Use when:**
- Preparing to implement a Linear ticket
- Need technical design before coding
- Want to document approach for a ticket
- Creating detailed implementation plan

**Do NOT use for:**
- Architectural decisions (use `Dev10x:adr` instead)
- Simple bug fixes with obvious solutions
- Quick tasks under 1 story point

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns
(Tier: Standard). It extends the base `scope` skill's orchestration
with Linear-specific tasks.

**Auto-advance:** Complete each phase and immediately start the next.
Never pause between phases to ask "should I continue?".

**REQUIRED: Create tasks before ANY work.** Execute these
`TaskCreate` calls at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Fetch Linear ticket context", activeForm="Fetching ticket")`
2. `TaskCreate(subject="Research technical context", activeForm="Researching codebase")`
3. `TaskCreate(subject="Design solution architecture", activeForm="Designing solution")`
4. `TaskCreate(subject="Estimate complexity and draft Job Story", activeForm="Estimating complexity")`
5. `TaskCreate(subject="Format and present scoping document", activeForm="Formatting scope")`
6. `TaskCreate(subject="Save and update Linear", activeForm="Saving scope")`

Set sequential dependencies: research blocked by fetch, design
blocked by research, estimate blocked by design, format blocked by
estimate, save blocked by format.

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text, call spec: [ask-scope-approval.md](./tool-calls/ask-scope-approval.md)) after
presenting the scope. This blocks execution until the user responds.
Options:
- Approve (Recommended) — Save document and optionally update Linear
- Revise — I have corrections to the scope
- More research needed — Need to explore additional areas
- Run PoC — Validate unverified architectural claims via a live
  proof-of-concept before approving (e.g., `claude -p` subprocesses,
  small scripts, or codebase probes that confirm a claim the scope
  depends on)

**When to surface "Run PoC":** Whenever the scope contains claims
the agent could not verify by reading the codebase alone (e.g.,
"approach X loads the plugin in a child session", "tool Y
propagates env vars to subprocesses"). Listing the option
short-circuits the manual escalation pattern observed in audit
session 1d53f6ec — the user otherwise has to invent the PoC step
themselves under "More research needed" (GH-33).

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Linear ticket ID (e.g., PAY-329)

**Optional:**
- External documentation URLs to research
- Specific areas of codebase to explore

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Ticket Context

#### 1.1 Fetch Ticket Details

```
Use Linear MCP to get ticket:
- Title
- Description
- Labels
- Assignee
- Related tickets
- Comments
```

#### 1.2 Check for Existing Context

Look for:
- Related tickets (blocks, blocked by, related to)
- Existing scoping documents
- Previous comments with context
- Attachments or links

### Phase 2: Technical Research (Uses base scope skill)

Follow the base `scope` skill for:

1. **Research external resources** (if provided)
2. **Explore existing codebase**
   - Find related patterns
   - Identify reusable components
3. **Identify components** (existing vs. new)

### Phase 3: Design Solution

#### 3.1 Determine Task Type

**Business Feature** - User-facing functionality
- Requires acceptance criteria
- May need release notes

**Technical Task** - Infrastructure/refactoring
- Technical depth only
- No user-facing changes

**Bug Fix** - Fixing broken behavior
- Root cause analysis
- Resolution summary

#### 3.2 Apply Design Principles

From base `scope` skill:
- YAGNI
- Follow existing patterns
- Clean Architecture

#### 3.3 Create Implementation Plan

Order steps by dependencies:
1. Types/DTOs
2. Client/Repository layer
3. Service layer
4. API layer
5. Tests

### Phase 4: Estimate Complexity

#### Story Points (Fibonacci)

| Points | Complexity | Duration |
|--------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Trivial | Hours |
| 2 | Small | < 1 day |
| 3 | Medium | 1-2 days |
| 5 | Large | 2-3 days |
| 8 | Complex | 3-5 days |
| 13 | Epic-sized | Should be split |

#### Estimation Factors

- New patterns vs. following existing
- Database migrations
- External dependencies
- Test complexity
- Review/iteration cycles

### Phase 4b: Draft Job Story

After estimating complexity, draft a Job Story for the ticket using the JTBD framework. This captures the business "why" early — before implementation begins — and will later be used in the PR description and release notes.

**REQUIRED: Call `Skill(Dev10x:jtbd)` in attended mode** (do NOT
draft the Job Story inline as prose inside the scope document).
Inline drafting bypasses jtbd's own context-gathering and
approval gate and breaks reusable orchestration (GH-27).

1. Pass the ticket context already gathered in Phase 1 (ticket
   details, parent ticket, related tickets) via the `context`
   parameter to avoid redundant API calls
2. The `Dev10x:jtbd` skill handles: situation identification,
   drafting, and user approval
3. Include the approved Job Story (the string returned by the
   skill) in the scoping document under a `## Job Story` section
   right after the title

**Anti-pattern (GH-27):** Writing a Job Story sentence directly
into the scope document Write call without a preceding
`Skill(Dev10x:jtbd)` invocation. Even when the resulting story
reads correctly, the skipped delegation is a compliance
violation — the jtbd skill's own attended-mode approval gate
must fire.

**Do NOT update the Linear ticket description at this point** — the story is saved in the scoping document and will be applied to the PR later via `Dev10x:ticket-jtbd` or `Dev10x:gh-pr-create`.

### Phase 5: Format Scoping Document

#### 5.1 Select Template

**REQUIRED: Read one of the three templates and use its
section structure.** Do NOT hand-craft the scope document
without consulting a template — different sessions produce
different shapes, breaking downstream consumers (PR creation,
project audit) that expect template-stable section names
(GH-28).

Pick by task type and `Read` the corresponding file before
writing the scope document:

- Business Feature → `references/business-feature-template.md`
- Technical Task → `references/technical-task-template.md`
- Bug Fix → `references/bug-fix-template.md`

**Verification:** Before the Phase 5.2 Write call that creates
the scope document, confirm the section headings match the
template's headings exactly (Job Story, Objective, Technical
Approach, Architecture, …). If a heading is missing or
renamed, you skipped the template — go back and read it.

**Anti-pattern (GH-28):** Writing
`/tmp/Dev10x/ticket-scope/<ID>-scope.md` with custom section
names ("Findings", "Approach Notes", etc.) instead of the
template's section names. Even when the content is correct,
the diverged structure breaks audits and PR generation.

#### 5.2 Complete All Sections

**Required sections:**
- Objective/Problem Statement
- Technical Approach
- Architecture (components, dependencies)
- Implementation Steps (with file paths)
- Code References
- Dependencies (tickets)
- Risks and Mitigations
- Acceptance Criteria
- Story Points

### Phase 6: User Review

**Critical:** Present scoping to user before saving.

Ask for feedback on:
- Architecture decisions
- Missing considerations
- Complexity estimate
- Implementation order

### Phase 7: Save and Update

#### 7.1 Save Scoping Document

```bash
# Save to /tmp for reference
/tmp/Dev10x/ticket-scope/TICKET-ID-scope.md
```

#### 7.2 Update Linear Ticket (Optional)

If user approves, update ticket with:
- Story point estimate
- Comment with architecture summary
- Links to related resources

**IMPORTANT:** Never modify ticket description without explicit user approval.
