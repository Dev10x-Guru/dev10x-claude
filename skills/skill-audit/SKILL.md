# Skill Audit

Analyze a Claude Code session transcript for skill compliance,
missed invocations, user corrections, and process improvements
worth persisting into skill definitions.

## Instructions

The full workflow — task creation, session resolution, wave
orchestration, phase references, and reporting — lives in
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md).

When this skill is invoked, Read `instructions.md` now and
follow it end-to-end. `TaskCreate` calls, `AskUserQuestion`
gates, and `Agent` dispatches documented there are REQUIRED.
