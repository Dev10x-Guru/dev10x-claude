# Create Commit

Create properly formatted git commits with gitmoji, ticket
reference, 72-char title limit, structured body, and outcome-
focused titles (JTBD style).

## Instructions

The full workflow — 12 steps covering branch validation, ticket
extraction, commit type, description prompts, solution points,
line-length validation, staging, and commit creation — lives in
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md).

When this skill is invoked, Read `instructions.md` now and
follow it end-to-end. `AskUserQuestion` gates documented there
are REQUIRED.
