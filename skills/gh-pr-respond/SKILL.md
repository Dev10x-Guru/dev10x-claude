# Respond to PR Review Comments

Recommended entry point for all PR review comments. Orchestrates
the full pipeline: collect comments, triage each one, implement
fixes, reply, and resolve threads. Do not call
`Dev10x:gh-pr-fixup` or `Dev10x:gh-pr-triage` directly unless
you are handling the full pipeline yourself.

## Instructions

The full workflow — single vs batch mode, triage routing, fixup
creation, thread resolution, parent detection — lives in
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md).

When this skill is invoked, Read `instructions.md` now and
follow it end-to-end. `TaskCreate` and `AskUserQuestion` calls
documented there are REQUIRED.
