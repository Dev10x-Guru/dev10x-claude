  TRIGGER when: user provides ticket URLs, PR links, Slack threads,
  Sentry issues, or free text to start structured work.
  DO NOT TRIGGER when: simple one-off tasks that don't need structured

# Dev10x:work-on — Adaptive Work Orchestrator

Turns any combination of inputs into a structured,
supervisor-approved work plan executed in four phases: parse,
gather, plan, execute.

## Instructions

The full orchestration contract — phase tasks, playbook
resolution, subagent dispatch, skill routing enforcement, and
completion gate — lives in
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md).

When this skill is invoked, Read `instructions.md` now and
follow it end-to-end. The `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, and
`AskUserQuestion` calls documented there are REQUIRED (blocking,
not advisory); do not substitute plain-text acknowledgements
for tool calls.
